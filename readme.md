See the brief summaries of each dataset below to try before you buy.

###Iris
This famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Each arrow above is a variable of our data set.

The columns of this dataset are:
- Sepal_Length
  - Length maxes/mins out out 7.9/4.3 respectively.
- Sepal_Width
  - Width has a very normal looking distribution centered around 3 with one outlier of 4.4.
- Petal_Length
  - This variable is very interesting with its bi-modal distribution. The smaller-value concentration is much tighter, while the higher-value distribution is spread out.
- Petal_Width
  - Pedal width distribution has a similar behaviour as petal width.
- Species
  - In this dataset we have 50 observations of each species: setosa, versicolor and viginica.

  ###Motor Trend Cars
  The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

The columns of this dataset are:
- id: car name
  - This dataset looks at 32 individual vehicles.
- mpg: miles per gallon
  -
- cyl: number of cylinders
- hp: gross horse power
- drat: the number of time the small gear at the end of the drive shaft must rotate in order to rotate the rear axel once
- wt: weight in thousands
- qsec: quarter mile time
- vs: V/S
- am: automatic or manual transimission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
- gear: number of forward gears
- carb: number of carborators
